# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

  Your answer: A parameter is a variable listed within a function. An argument is the value that passes through the function when it is called.

  Researched answer: Parameters and argument are sometimes said interchangebly, but there is a minute difference. A parameter is a variable listed within a function, while an argument is the value that passes through said function when it is called.



2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: To my current understanding, .map() has 3 parameters: Value, index, and array. Only value is required. 

  Researched answer: To the current understanding, .map() has 3 parameter:value, index, and array. Value is a required parameter and represences the value of the array at its current iteration. The parameters index and array are not required, however they represent the index of the arrayat the current iteration and the array the "Hof" was called on, respectively.



3. What is the difference between map and filter?

  Your answer: Map allows you to take a complete list and make changes. Filter allows you to select specific items from a list. 

  Researched answer: The map() method takes every array element and allows you to manipulate the list in its entirety, thereby creating a new array. The filter() method takes an array, and runs a "test" on every array element, that identifies elements with desired characteristics. The .filter() method is best utilized when you only want specific items from an array, like only "string" or numbers.



4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer: A function is a reusable set of instructions that perform a specific task. Methods are very similar to function within the concept of being reusable and performing a particular task, but methods are built in functions.

  Researched answer:A function is a reusable set of instructions that perform a specific task. Methods are very similar to function within the concept of being reusable and performing a particular task, but methods are built in functions that belongs to an object.



5. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer:Destructuring is taking a key value pair from within an object, and giving it a new variable to access the data from outside of said object.

  Researched answer: Destructuring is a expression that allows us to extract data from, arrays, objects, and maps, then set them into new variables.



6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: I think its order of execution.

  Researched answer: The process of "hosting", is when the Javascript interpreter splits the declaration and assignment of functions and variables, by 'hoisting' declarations of functions to the top of their scope before execution.
